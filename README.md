# Mandelbrot Set Calculator

This project is a Python-based Mandelbrot Set Calculator developed within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The main objective was to calculate and visualize the Mandelbrot set with high detail without relying on any pre-built calculators. To achieve this, Python multithreading was utilized to enhance the performance and detail level beyond what could be achieved with simple matrix operations or NumPy alone.

## Features

- **Mandelbrot Set Calculation**: Computes the Mandelbrot set using custom Python code.
- **Multithreading**: Optimizes the computation by leveraging Python's multithreading capabilities, allowing for more detailed visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The entire project, including code and visualizations, is contained within a single Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to modify and experiment with.
